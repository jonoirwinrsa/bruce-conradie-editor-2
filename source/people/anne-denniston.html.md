Anne Denniston has edited fiction and non-fiction for more than 20 years. She is an accredited editor with the South African Translators Institute and is an expert in document formatting.

She uses Microsoft Word templates and styles to format documents before she edits them because she believes that a document’s appearance is important for creating the good first impression that will encourage potential readers to actually read it. Then she edits spelling, punctuation, grammar, logic, and flow to polish the text.

Anne edited and formatted Dr Erik Hofstee’s book,Constructing a Good Dissertation, and compiled the back sectionthat explains and gives examples of the Harvard, APA and Chicago referencing styles.

Her advanced knowledge of the Microsoft Office suite and other software has equipped her with many tools and shortcuts that enable her to work quickly and efficiently.

Anne trained as a librarian and worked in a provincial library, an architectural library, and a Blindiana Library, where she learned desktop publishing. She has written policies and procedures for ISO compliance, and edited work in the fields of agriculture, auditing, business, education, engineering, and provincial government.
