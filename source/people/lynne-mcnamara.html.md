Lynne McNamara has extensive experience in medical research. She had a particular interest in the disease of African Iron Overload and was involved in a large study sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health.

She was involved in developing a method of measuring non-transferrin-bound iron using high pressure liquid chromatography. In 1999, she was awarded an MTech for her thesis titled Non-Transferrin-Bound Iron and Hepatic Dysfunction in African Dietary Iron Overload.

In 2002, Lynne graduated with an MSc (Med) from the University of the Witwatersrand, awarded for her thesis titled Mutations of the HFE Gene in Osteoporosis and Arthritis. She has authored and co-authored over 20 peer reviewed articles and presented work at various international and national conferences.

She spent a number of years at the Clinical HIV Research Unit working in the field of epidemiology and nutrition. She currently works as a Senior Researcher in the MRC Common Epithelial Cancer Research Centre based at Wits Medical School. This group is involved in large-scale epidemiological and laboratory studies of breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancer.

Lynne assists postgraduate students in the Wits Faculty of Health Sciences with preparation of manuscripts and journal articles.

Lynne has a life-long love of reading and of the English language. In her spare time she reads extensively, mostly non-fiction.
