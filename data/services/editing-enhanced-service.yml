  An Enhanced Service is not available for documents written to fulfil the
  requirements of a qualification (such as, PhD, Masters, or Honours).


  An Enhanced Service is a Standard Service with the following sentence- and paragraph-level enhancements:


  * Improving expression, diction, syntax, and style

  * Flagging text for potential improvements (for example, identifying wordiness, repetition, statements of the obvious or inflated truth claims)

  * Commenting on content (not needing domain-specific knowledge)
